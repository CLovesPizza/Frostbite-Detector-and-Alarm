# Frostbite-Detector-and-Alarm
This repo contains the source code of the Hackaday Prize project, Frostbite Detector and Alarm.
This project aims to tackle frostbite by giving easy to understand warnings on when to take shelter, and when frostbite is imminent.
The device is mainly aimed at children, to prevent injury due to frostbite or hypothermia, due to a misunderstanding or lack of situational awareness on the part of the child.
